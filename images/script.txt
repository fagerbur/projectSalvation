Let's start off at the very beginning...

Where did we come from?

<!-- the pre-existence -->

"God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth."

Jeremiah 1:5
Old Testament
5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
